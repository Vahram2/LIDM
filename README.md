**Liner Programing Algorithm for Optimization -  Labye’s iterative discontinuous method**

Pipe size of pressurized irrigation networks that usually have a branched layout had been optimized by assuming a predetermined layout. Few researches have considered simultaneous layout and pipe size optimization. In this study, a hybrid approach that is a combination of pipe size optimizer and layout optimizer is adapted for simultaneous layout and pipe size optimization. Once the solutions (specific layouts) are developed, a modified version of Labye’s iterative discontinuous method (LIDM) is applied to optimize pipe sizes. After the layout optimizer rearranges, the solutions and the process continues. Two versions of a new discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used as tree layout optimizer, namely, original jumping PSO (JPSO) and tree growing JPSO (TG-JPSO). In the original JPSO, a loop model network is considered first, and a spanning tree is produced by using JPSO for eliminating certain branches. Tree growing JPSO without producing a loop model directly deals with branched layout. The proposed methods are applied on three benchmark examples. The results showed that using the proposed approach leads to better solutions with a very small number of function evaluation. However, compared with the existing nonhybrid approaches, the hybrid approach takes a longer CPU time to calculate objective function because of the application of LIDM for pipe sizes optimization.
